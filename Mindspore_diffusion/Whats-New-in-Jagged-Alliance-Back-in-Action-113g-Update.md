One of the main additions in this update is the hard difficulty level, which you can choose when you start a new game. This mode will make the enemies stronger, reduce your income and starting funds, and make the game more challenging. You can also try the tactical mode, which changes how you see the enemies on the map. In this mode, you have to reveal the enemies by line of sight, and you can also see sound sources on the tactical view and the minimap. This mode adds more realism and stealth to the game.
 
Another new feature is the sector inventory, which you can access via the Character Detail Screen. This inventory shows all the items that you have found in a friendly sector, including containers that you have opened and enemy drops that you have spotted. You can use this inventory to recruit militia, trade with NPCs, or exchange items between your mercs. You can also distribute militia across different combat zones via the location UI on the world map.
 
The update also improves the interface and the weapon system of the game. For example, you can now see the actual accuracy of each weapon in the description, as well as other useful information such as weapon class, pros and cons, and compatible attachments. You can also see the targeting line change color from green to red depending on your chance to hit and your weapon's best range. Moreover, your current ammo is saved for each weapon, and weapons are unloaded when you hand them over to militia.
 
The update also fixes some bugs and exploits that affected the game balance and stability. For instance, it fixes some issues with item duplication, squad selection, HP regeneration, quest rewards, guard mode, mail list, and more. You can read the full changelog of the update on Steam[^2^] or Mod DB[^1^].
 
If you want to enhance your gaming experience even more, you can also check out some of the mods available for Jagged Alliance: Back in Action. One of them is the Realistic Rebalancing Mod[^1^], which adds a lot of improvements and bugfixes to the game without changing the base gameplay. This mod reworks all weapons to be more realistic and balanced, reworks ammunition to reflect real life characteristics, adds more items for sale by traders, adds 47 new weapons to the campaign, fixes several errors and typos, and more.
 
Jagged Alliance: Back in Action is a game that offers a lot of replay value and customization options for fans of tactical RPGs. With the latest update and some mods, you can enjoy this game even more and face new challenges and possibilities. If you haven't played this game yet, you can get it on Steam for $19.99.
